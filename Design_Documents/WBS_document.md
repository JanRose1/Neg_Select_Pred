---------------
First Major output
- Activity 1: Download Dataset
  -  [] Task 1.1: Download FASTA files 
  -  [] Task 1.2: Prep Datasets and separate protein sequences if necesarry 
   -  How is Data prepared?
   -  Matrix containing Gene ID, Gene Symbol, number of nucleotides, Chromosome, location and orientation as Values in Matrix in seperate
      Columns
  - [] Task 1.3: Input data and read into my code
- Activity 2: Check for abnormalities
  -  [] Compare FASTA file sequences and compare with known sequence that acts as a baseline. 
  -  [] Check variations against known variations that cause pathological effects
  -  [] Check variation for chances in charge and binding
  -  [] Calculate potential binding threshold of the AIRE gene and determine if proteins would still be functional for others
- Activity 3: Create set of lymphocytes with randomly generated binding coefficients
- Activity 4: Model lymphocytes that would have CD8+ and CD4+ expression even with gene mutation
- Activity 5: Simulate binding of Lymphocytes to AIRE and MHC I and II for positive and negative selection and determine which ones survive
- Activity 6: Provide basic statistics determining lymphocytes that survived given the various combinations of parameters from the initial datasets
- Output 7: Put all this data in a table
