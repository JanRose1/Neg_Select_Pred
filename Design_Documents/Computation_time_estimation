Breakdown

Assumption: Will be using an amino acid sequence of a total of 20 AA as a baseline.

- Read in Fasta File of Amino Acid Sequences. (1s)
- Simulate protein Folding (400 seconds for amino acid sequence of 20 AA. Time increments by approximately 20s as sequence length n increases)
- Clean Lattice structure (3s for an amino acid sequence of 20AA increase by .25s)
- Calculate Free Energy change (3s) (*2)
  - Calculate change in Entropy (1s)
  - Calculate change in Enthalpy (1s)
  - Calculate change in free energy (1s)
 - Determine Negative selection (1s)
  - Compare free energy change of MHC binding to peptide antigen to that of peptide antigen binding to TCell
  
  408 seconds total or about 6.8 minutes.
