Everything takes 2 seconds 
- Read in Data
-Set up environment
- Compute K binding based on the given parameters of AIRE
- Calculate Positive selection chance based on K binding 
  - Determine if it should go through apoptosis
  - Determine if apoptosis was correctly triggered
  - Determine what the cell would differentiate to
- Calculate Negative selection chance based on K binding
  - Calculate Positive selection chance based on K binding 
  - Determine if it should go through apoptosis
  - Determine if apoptosis was correctly triggered
  - Determine what the cell would differentiate to
  
  23 reaction repeat on approximately 200 cells each step takes optimally 2 seconds 
  9,200 seconds total or about 2 hours and 30 minutes.
