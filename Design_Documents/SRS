#Database Selection


To start we'll be taking Fasta files that go over variations of the nucleotide sequence of AIRE, CD8A, and RFXANK, and CD4 genes. 
Each data source has the following number of targets and average number of nucleotides: 
-AIRE: 1 target; 2690 nucleotides 
-CD8A: 9 targets; 1995 nucleotides
-RFXANK: 21 targets ; 1264 nucleotide average
-CD4: 9 targets; 2956 nucleotide average

General assumption
Breakdown
Everything takes 2 seconds 
- Read in Data
-Set up environment
- Compute K binding based on the given parameters of AIRE
- Calculate Positive selection chance based on K binding 
  - Determine if it should go through apoptosis
  - Determine if apoptosis was correctly triggered
  - Determine what the cell would differentiate to
- Calculate Negative selection chance based on K binding
  - Calculate Positive selection chance based on K binding 
  - Determine if it should go through apoptosis
  - Determine if apoptosis was correctly triggered
  - Determine what the cell would differentiate to
  
  23 reaction repeat on approximately 200 cells each step takes optimally 2 seconds 
  9,200 seconds total or about 2 hours and 30 minutes.
