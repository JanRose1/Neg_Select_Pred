#Database Selection


To start we'll be taking Fasta files that go over variations of the nucleotide sequence of AIRE, CD8A, and RFXANK, and CD4 genes. 
Each data source has the following number of targets and average number of nucleotides: 
-AIRE: 1 target; 2690 nucleotides 
-CD8A: 9 targets; 1995 nucleotides
-RFXANK: 21 targets ; 1264 nucleotide average
-CD4: 9 targets; 2956 nucleotide average

The following mathematical computation takes into consideration the targets number of nucleotides and cores necessarry.

All of these files are fasta files that contain information about the gene in question. The transcript length, protein length, orientation, gene type and protein name.
The total transcript length includes UTR and exons and the site of origin for each of the datasets includes a total exon count for the gene.
