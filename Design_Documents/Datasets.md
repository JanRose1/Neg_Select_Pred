**Preface**

I will be pulling various fasta file sequences from uniprot.org related to functional variations of amino acid sequences of MHC I alpha 1 and alpha 2 subunits, MHC II alpha1 and Alpha2, and the variable regions of mTEC molecules.


The Fasta files will only contain information about the sequence and what molecule they correspond to. 

More information about the proteins follows:

- MHC I and II: Major histocompatability Complex molecules are found on antigen presenting cells. These regulate immune responses of the body and make sure that immune cells don't initiate auto-immune responses against the body's own immune system. 

- Variable Regions of T-Cell Receptor molecules: Bind to antigens and plays a role in the adaptive immune response.

- CD4: Coreceptor with T-cell receptor on T lymphocyte to recognize antigens displayed by antigens presenting class II MHC molecules. Is used to bind to 
AIRE to determine cell fate.

- CD8: Coreceptor with T-cell receptor on T lymphocyte to recognize antigens displayed by antigens presenting class I MHC molecules. Is used to bind to 
AIRE to determine cell fate.
