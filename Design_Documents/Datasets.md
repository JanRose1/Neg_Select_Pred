I will be pulling various datasets from the national library of medicine related to functional variations of the nucleotide sequences of AIRE, CD8A, and RFXANK, and CD4 genes. \
\
I'll also be utilizing the APECED Database as a means of comparing variations of the aforemationed sequences with recorded variations that have been known to cause deviance in T Cell maturation.

All of these files are fasta files that contain information about the gene in question. The transcript length, protein length, orientation, gene type and protein name.
The total transcript length includes UTR and exons and the site of origin for each of the datasets includes a total exon count for the gene.

More information about the proteins follows:

AIRE- Autoimmune regulator which codes for the tolerogenesis that determines the formation of autoantibodies directed against self antigens. 

CD8A - Coreceptor with T-cell receptor on T lymphocyte to recognize antigens displayed by antigens presenting class I MHC molecules. Is used to bind to 
AIRE to determine cell fate.

CD4 - Coreceptor with T-cell receptor on T lymphocyte to recognize antigens displayed by antigens presenting class II MHC molecules. Is used to bind to 
AIRE to determine cell fate.

RFXANK - This protein binds to X box motif of certain MHC class II gene promotors and stirs their transcription.
