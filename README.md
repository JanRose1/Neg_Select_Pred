# BIOINF576
This project will essentially cover the following 

# **Goal**

Establishing an analysis of the thymus's self regulatory system that kills off self-recognizing T-Cells by a means known as negative selection. Typically # most of the self-recognizing T-cells are killed off by the thymus for obvious reasons of wanting to avoid having these T-cells attack the host's immune system and thus cause a form of autoimmune disease. That said, it seems that some self-identifying T-cells are left alive and play some sort of role in immune system homeostasis by becoming further specialized after having survived this "cleansing" process. A lot of literature still doesn't quite understand why this happens and what specific factors come into play to determine which self-recognizing T-Cells are left alive and what they should specialize as.  
Hence my goal is to make a system that can predict self-recognizing T-cells that escape negative selection and the way they are kept under control within the host's body.

**Input:**

Database of T-Cells with information of what they recognize

**Output:** 

Prediction of which self-recognizing T-Cells survive negative selection and what they're predicted to differentiate into.
