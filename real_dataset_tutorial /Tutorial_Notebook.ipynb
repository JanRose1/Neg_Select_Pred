Should time permit the project scope may expand beyond just this single set of interactions. This way multiple variable regions can be quickly tested against various potential peptide expressions to determine which undergo negative selection and which will avoid it all together.\n"

    "This code can be used to quickly understand how changes in amino acid sequence can impact the strength of binding of the TCell receptor variable region to that of the expressed peptide antigen. In doing so many variable region sequences can be tested for when developing chimeric t-cells to better gauge if the TCell may undergo negative selection. "
